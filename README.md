# 🕶️ Specs Detection Website

This is a **learning-based project** designed to detect whether a person is wearing **specs (glasses)** or not using facial recognition. The model is trained using TensorFlow Lite and deployed in a web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- To explore **AI-based facial feature extraction**
- To learn how to train and quantize a model using **TensorFlow Lite**
- To build a simple **web-based interface** for real-time model inference
- To begin practical experience with **AI + Web development integration**

## 🧠 AI Model

- The model is trained on **two categories**:  
  - **With Specs**
  - **Without Specs**
- Used **TensorFlow Lite** for model optimization
- Converted to a **quantized `.tflite` model** for efficient browser inference
